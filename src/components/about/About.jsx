                Born and raised in Canada I now call Sweden home.
                I am currently a student at Chas Academy studying Fullstack-Development. The course 
                is two years with the goal of proficiency in web development with a particular focus on Javascript,
                and Typescript. I have a special interest in accessible design because I feel the whole purpose of 
                technology is to make the world as accessible as possible for everyone. Iâ€™m looking for opportunities
                where I can learn and develop new skills.
